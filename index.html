            At AXA partners, I am currently part of the Data Team at the frontier between Data engineering and business.
            Since I have started working at Axa, I have strived to grow a data solution from a proof of concept to a
            mature product. The solution aims to handle the low level, end customer transactional data received from
            intermediary partner businesses such as banks. This data has significant business value, typically in deal
            profitability analysis. Gigabytes of data storing millions of euros worth of insurance premiums is crunched
            by this solution every month. The challenge is in handling the variety, complexity and unreliability of
            files sent by the 16 different partners. <br>
            <br> As a data engineer, my main task has been to propose and implement solutions to facilitate the
            migration of the pilot solution to the Microsoft Azure cloud environment whilst minimising the impact on
            existing processes. I have also been in charge of configuring pipelines and building models for new partner
            datasets. I have also built powerBI reports required for certain datasets. <br><br>
            In addition to bringing technical expertise, I have further invested myself in the project’s growth by
            training potential users, and leading the project’s steering committee involving all of the project’s
            stakeholders.

        <span id="sub_att"> Advanced Track &amp; Trace offers product tracking and authentication solutions
            worldwide.<br><br> I am the main contributer to the development of a new authentication product from
            defining the algorithm, to project management, to technical sales. The said product can be assimilated to
            a qr code, invisible to the human eye, that when scanned with a smartphone, identifies the product it seals,
            and guarentees its authenticity. </span>
        <span id="sub_surys"> Surys offers hologram based, anti-counterfeiting solutions, worldwide.<br><br>As part of
            the software R&amp;D department, my main purpose was to research and design hologram authentication
            algorithms using computer vision and machine learning techniques. I also mentored an engineering master’s
            student through his final year internship at SURYS.<br><br>My most noticeable accomplishment was to
            successfully tightened SURYS’ relationship with Keesing, SURYS’ Dutch subsidiary, as I took part in defining
            their business strategy.</span>
        <span id="sub_deloitte"> I developed software routines to transfer and format data from one database to
            another.</span>
        <span id="sub_givee"> Givee is an on-line gift platform start-up. As a team of five, working from Google's
            incubator (London, UK), we took Givee from an idea to a registered company with a functional website.</span>
        <span id="sub_ah"> I managed the integration of a new database in a department. This included supervising the
            subcontracted development work, performing data migrations, and training future users. In addition, I
            provided support for any heavy Excel workload requiring VBA expertise.</span>
        <span id="sub_pmipdn"> Over a 2 week training program, I impersonated a soldier of the French Air Force.
            Succeeding in this experience required strong resilience, mentally and physically. I particularly
            distinguished myself through my subordination and leadership skills.</span>
        <span id="sub_mun"> The point of MUN is to debate global, political issues following the formalities and rules
            of the UN. Delegates/Students are assigned countries along with a topic to research. Policy proposals are
            made by the most experienced delegates under the form of resolutions which are then debated in
            committee.<br><br>I was Student director of my high-school's club and organized a conference of 300
            participants. <br> <br>I also participated to major world wide conferences:<br> - THIMUN (3000+
            participants)<br> - PAMUN (1000+ participants)</span>
